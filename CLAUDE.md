# Claude Code Configuration

> For general project instructions, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Claude-Specific Behavior

When working on this codebase, Claude Code should:

- Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits
- Do NOT include Claude Code signature/footer in commits
- Keep commit messages clean and standard (no AI attribution)
- When user asks to "commit" with approval, follow the full release workflow in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md#release-steps)
