# Claude Code Configuration

> For general project instructions, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md).

## Claude-Specific Behavior

When working on this codebase, Claude Code should:

- Do NOT include `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits
- Do NOT include Claude Code signature/footer in commits
- Do NOT commit or create tags without explicit user approval
- Keep commit messages clean and standard (no AI attribution)
